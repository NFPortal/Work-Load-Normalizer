Purpose: Takes user defined processes and a start and finish time to divide the number of processes by the ammount of time alotted. Program will state the average time for completion of one process and will show either red or green if ahead of projected calculated times.

Major Parts:
	1) User Defined Variables
		a) Alloted Time Begin (Use datetime)
		b) Alloted Time End (Use datetime)
		c) Todo List of all unique processes with optional input for static times such as breaks.
		
	2) Time alloted calulator to divide processes evenly
		a) Subtract static times from alloted time
		
Notes:
Track data and average times for each process
Add specific keybind to add lap
Save all data
Add option to add a certain amount of hours instead of start and end time
List can be recaluculated at any time to allow for quick switching of prioritied or other processes but must have an apply button wth a confirmation messege
Using logged info - if all processes already have an average time associated, then give toast at the top that says "You woud have an average of XX:XX free time if you keep up with the averages"

TODO:
Add html for user to add start and finish times
	Format will be datetime format HH:MM:SS with 00 for seconds but only show HH:SS

Add user Defined TODO List	
	Should have a plus that pulls up a new screen with a text box for Name of Process and Checkbox that says static that pulls another text box to input a time
		Static Time will subtract from alloted time
	TODO list should short automatically into Static Times
	Priority List should be incorperated as either dropdown or text
		
	
Add Calculator to nominize times throughout the day
	Anything without a time added by a user will be divided evenly into the day from alloted time
	Anything with a time added by the user will just be listed in order of priority with the time set. This will subtract the time from the total alloted time to stretch any non defined time
